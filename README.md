# big number calculator

## are you stuck with big numbers calc?? don't worry this projcet will help you to use them

in all computers we have some limit for numbers like int or float...
so we can't do some functions when some numbers grow to over limit...
but we can use this project code to handle them in one list(or string) type
and you can write all math functions on this projct


## some commands for developers

for modules we need just regex module for controlling the numbers

some hint for files:
1. we have one main file writes big number that we have class and functions in it
2. in checkpanel, we do some math calcs for get better results for the math calcs
3. env for file our enivornement

## hints for usage:
* all functions return one BN type number for us...but you can use it in every time
* i try to write large amount of function in this project and i will update in future time
* this class can get list of numbers...one string or one number like int

# notice: this class doesn't support float numbers

yes you can't use float numbers in this type of the big number class


## some hints for users

1. for making one obj of this class you just write BN(num)
2. all functions overwrited and you must just use them in function like one int type
3. i maked list slices to! so you can get for example 7th number of one big number


i hope you to enjoy this code and use it in your projects...
i will add other functions in near time too! so don't forgot to see this page again!
